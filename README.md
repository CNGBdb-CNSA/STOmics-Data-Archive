# STOmics-Data-Archive

The realization of the importance of the spatial organization and the exact position of molecular features, historically unobtained in bulk and single cell experiments, have driven the technological advancements in spatially resolved transcriptomics.

An approach is to capture transcripts in situ, then perform sequencing ex situ. Stereo-seq developed by BGI Stereomics, and Visum Spatial Gene Experession developed by 10x Genomics, are two popular technologies that combined spatial chip and in situ RNA capture technology.

Here, we have created a standard for data archiving of these two technologies. The data model is as follows.
