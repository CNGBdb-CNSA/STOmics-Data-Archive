\*Sample scope

* Definition:

  | The scope and purity of the biological sample used for the study.
  | Choose Multiisolate as the Scope when the goal of the research is to compare multiple individuals or strains of the same species, eg, in a “Variation” or “Genome sequencing and assembly” project.
  | Choose Multispecies when different species are being examined.
  | Choose Monoisolate if the goal is to make a single genome or transcriptome assembly, even if more than one individual was the source of the DNA or RNA.
