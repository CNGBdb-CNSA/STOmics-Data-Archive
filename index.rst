SpatioTemporal Omics Data Archive
================================================

Welcome to the documents for submission of SpatioTemporal Omics data for `STOmics DB <https://db.cngb.org/stomics/>`_. Please use the links to find instructions specific to your needs.

The realization of the importance of the spatial organization and the exact position of molecular features, historically unobtained in bulk and single cell experiments, have driven the technological advancements in spatially resolved transcriptomics.

An approach is to capture transcripts in situ, then perform sequencing ex situ.

`Stereo-seq <https://www.stomics.tech/>`_ developed by **BGI Genomics**, and `Visium Spatial Gene Expression <https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression>`_ developed by **10x Genomics**, are two popular technologies that combined spatial chip and in situ RNA capture technology.
